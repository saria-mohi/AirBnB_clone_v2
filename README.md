AIRBNB TEAM PROJECT
# INTRODUCTION:
The goal of the project is to deploy on the server a simple copy of the AirBnB website
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

# Steps:
First: create the repository
Second: create modules Base Modle,User, Review, Place, State, City and Amenity

# Tasks:
 ## Mandatory: 

   ### Task0. README, AUTHORS
   - Write a README.md
   - You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository.

   ### Task1. Be pycodestyle compliant!
    - Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.

   ### Task2. Unittests
    - All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests

   ### Task3. BaseModel
    - Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes

   ### Task4. Create BaseModel from dictionary
    - Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

   ### Task5. Store first object
    - Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation

   ### Task6. Console 0.0.1
    - Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter

   ### Task7. Console 0.1
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands:

   ### Task8. First User
    - Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter

   ### Task8. First User
    - Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter

   ### Task8. First User
    - Write a class User that inherits from BaseMode

   ### Task9. More classes!
    - Create State, City, Amenity, Review and Palce classes

   ### Task10. Console 1.0
    - Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.

 ## Advanced:

   ### Task11. All instances by class name
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve all instances of a class by using: <class name>.all()

   ### Task12. Count instances
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve the number of instances of a class: <class name>.count().

   ### Task13. Show
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve an instance based on its ID: <class name>.show(<id>).
    - Errors management must be the same as previously.

   ### Task14. Destroy
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to destroy an instance based on his ID: <class name>.destroy(<id>).
    - Errors management must be the same as previously.

   ### Task15. Update
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: <class name>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>).
    - Errors management must be the same as previously.

  ### Task15. Update
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: <class name>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>).
    - Errors management must be the same as previously.

  ### Task16. Update from dictionary
    - Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID with a dictionary: <class name>.update(<id>, <dictionary representation>).
    - Errors management must be the same as previously.

  ### Task17. Unittests for the Console!
    - Write all unittests for console.py, all features!
    - For testing the console, you should “intercept” STDOUT of it, we highly recommend you to use
